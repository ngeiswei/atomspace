 barrier

    means that the atomspace, as a client of the storage server, has

 load-atomspace - load all atoms from storage.

    This will cause ALL of the atoms in the open storage server to be
    loaded into the current AtomSpace. This can be a very time-consuming
    operation.  In normal operation, it is rarely necessary to load all
    atoms; there are several ways to fetch subsets of atoms, or even one
    at a time, when needed.

    See also:
    fetch-atom ATOM -- fetch an individual ATOM, and all Values on it.
    fetch-incoming-set ATOM -- fetch the entire incoming set of ATOM.
    fetch-incoming-by-type ATOM TYPE -- get a subset of the incoming set.
    fetch-query QUERY -- get all Atoms for a given QUERY.
    load-referers ATOM -- get every graph that contains ATOM
    load-atoms-of-type TYPE -- load only atoms of type TYPE

 store-atomspace - Store all atoms in the AtomSpace to storage.

    This will dump the ENTIRE contents of the current AtomSpace to the
    the currently-open storage.  Depending on the size of the AtomSpace,
    this may take a lot of time.  During normal operation, a bulk-save
    is rarely required, as individual atoms can always be stored, one
    at a time.

(define*-public (fetch-query QUERY KEY
	#:optional (METADATA '()) (FRESH #f))
"
 fetch-query QUERY KEY [METADATA [FRESH]]

   Perform the QUERY at the storage server, and load the results into
   the AtomSpace. The results will be returned directly and also cached
   at KEY. The QUERY must be either a JoinLink, MeetLink or QueryLink.

   This can be thought of as a generalization of `load-referers`,
   `fetch-incoming-set` and `fetch-incoming-by-type`. Thus, the
   simplest JoinLink is effectively the same thing as `load-referers`,
   while a JoinLink with a depth of one is the same thing as
   `fetch-incoming-set`, and a JoinLink with a type restriction is the
   same thing as `fetch-incoming-by-type`.

   The storage server is free to return previously cached results for
   the query, instead of running it freshly. The storage server is
   free to refuse to perform the search.

   The METADATA Atom is optional.  If it is specified, then metadata
   about the search results is placed on QUERY at the key METADATA.
   This may include a time-stamp of when the search was performed,
   or an indicator that the search was refused (was not performed.)

   The FRESH boolean value is optional. If set to #t, then it is
   a request to the storage server to re-run the query, instead of
   returning previously cached results. The storage server may not
   honor this request; status is returned in METADATA.

   Not all storage servers are capable of performing all queries.
   If a storage server is unable to perform a query, the status
   is placed at the METADATA key.

   See also:
     `fetch-incoming-set` to fetch the incoing set of an Atom.
     `load-referers` to fetch all graphs containing an Atom.
